    <h1>Aspin</h1>
    <p>
        Aspin is short for asong Pinoy, meaning Philippine native dog. 
        We love our aspins and would prefer to consider them the Philippine Special.
        Aspins are warm, friendly, playful and affectionate, and would be a loyal member of any family, 
        returning their owner’s love tenfold.

<h1>FOOD</h1>
<p>Feeding Aspin dogs a homemade diet can be a great way to ensure they get the nutrients they need, especially if they are picky. Here are some recommendations for homemade foods that are generally well-received by dogs:</p>

      <h1>HABITAT</h1>
      <p>
        Often see aspins on the road because of other owners who neglected them to the streets, one of their habitats. 
        There are other aspins who have dog houses because some owners do too much care for aspins.

            <li> Regular visits to the vet are essential to check your Aspin's health.
                 They need to be vaccinated against common canine diseases and regularly dewormed. 
                 Regular check-ups also help identify any potential health issues early, increasing the chances of successful treatment.</li> <br>
          <li>Consider a home vet visit if you want to avoid the hassle of commuting or waiting in line! PetPal’s partner vets can visit your pet at home and perform a comprehensive check-up to ensure your furry pal’s health.</li>
