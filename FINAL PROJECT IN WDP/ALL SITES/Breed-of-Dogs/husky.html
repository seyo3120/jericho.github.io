    <h1>Husky</h1>
    <p>
        Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. 
        Sibes are friendly, fastidious, and dignified. The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky's almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue'and sometimes one of each'and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression.
         Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait.
         Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, 
         the Alaskan Malamute.

        <p>The most well-known sign of a happy dog is a high and wagging tail.
             Although every dog breed has a different relaxed tail position, happy dogs will generally raise their tails slightly. 
             And when a dog is really happy, his whole body can wiggle along with his wagging tail.</p>
