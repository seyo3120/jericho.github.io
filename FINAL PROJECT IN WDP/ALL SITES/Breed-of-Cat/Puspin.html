        <h1>PUSPIN</h1>
        <p>Puspin is short for Pusang Pinoy (Filipino Cat). This is what we now call the Filipino cat breed. They used to be called "Pusakal"
            which is short for Pusang Kalye (street cat) but Filipino animal rights and welfare advocates fought to change that coinage because it 
            carried such a negative impression for our beloved furry friends. Lately, Puspins are being sought out by many for their personal animal 
            companions. As to why it is so, let us look closely into this special cat breed.</p>

        </div>
    </section>
        <div class="div-3">
        <p class="center-align">The Puspin cat has a load of personality and is often revered for its quirky, lovable nature. They tend to have a sweet 
            temperament but can also be aloof or weary when approached by a stranger.
            <br>
            Most Puspin carry a sense of street smarts incorporated into their instincts, as they've graced the streets of many a neighborhood for several millennia.
            <br>
            How they're treated while out and about will reflect how they behave around strangers. They are either very quiet or noisy cats, being no happy medium.</p>

              <div class="circle"></div>
                <p>Your cat needs to be comfortable having their body handled for grooming purposes. To help ease them into it, run your hands around your feline's body, 
                giving them loads of praise. Your cat will probably enjoy this but watch for signs of discomfort or annoyance like tail swishing or growling. If that happens, try going slower, but don't give up!</p>

          <div class="grooming-item">
              <div class="circle"></div>
              <p>Hold their paw in one hand and clip with bladed nail trimmers with your other hand. You want to clip the nail in the same direction as the curve and only cut the sharp tip.</li>

          </div>
          <div class="grooming-item">
              <div class="circle"></div>
              <p>There isn't a huge need to clean your cat's ears regularly, but if you notice they look a little dirty or have a funky smell, it's worth taking a peek. When in doubt, ask your veterinarian how often they think your cat's ears should be cleaned.</p>

          <div class="grooming-item">
              <div class="circle"></div>
              <p>Though dental care can happen anytime (and we highly encourage it does!) it's always nice when you can tack it onto your grooming routine. More cats than you think develop periodontal disease, which can cause many more health problems than just smelly breath. </p>
