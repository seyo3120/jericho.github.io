        <h1>Americal Curl</h1>
        <p>This well-muscled cat, while not large, has a long body compared to the overall size. The American Curl has 
            medium-sized bones so she is not a delicate cat despite the length of the body.
            The head of the American Curl is wedge shaped with eyes that are shaped like a walnut. Her tail is long. Her 
            unique feature, of course, is that her ears curl backwards. Her ears are large, and curve in a smooth arc of 
            at least 90 degrees. The natural fur in her ears is apparent. The tips of her ears should be flexible and can 
            be handled without any complaints from her. 
            The coat texture of the American Curl is silky, whether she is a short hair or a long hair. The hair length on 
            the long haired curl is really more semi-long than long. The American Curl is accepted in all colors and patterns.</p>

        <p class="center-align">She's adaptable and good-natured, which makes her the ideal family companion.Although she loves attention from her people, including children, the American Shorthair does not like being carried 
                and is fairly independent.She may curl up in your lap on occasion, but she may prefer to sit alongside you instead.
                She'll get along fine with a cat-friendly dog, but her hunting instincts may take over with pet birds and other small animals.</p>

              <div class="circle"></div>
                <p>Your American Shorthair will shed but combing a couple times per week removes dead hair and redistributes skin oils to keep her coat shiny and prevent dry, itchy skin.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="grooming-item">
              <div class="circle"></div>
              <p>This is not a breed that requires much grooming, but like all cats with hair, they shed their undercoat during the spring. A lighter fall shed, affecting the guard hairs, follows. 
                Daily brushing is recommended; a wire toothed slicker brush or a grooming mitt is perfect for an American's short coat and is generally all that is needed to keep shedding under control. 
                Bathing helps remove excess oils and further reduces shedding, but is usually unnecessary unless the cat is being shown.

          <div class="grooming-item">
              <div class="circle"></div>
              <p>These cats are good about keeping themselves clean. They shouldn't need a bath, but they'll sometimes get into something particularly dirty, and you'll have to help get them clean. 
                You'll usually know just by looking when your cat has gotten into something that's so bad they can't lick themselves clean. </p>

          <div class="grooming-item">
              <div class="circle"></div>
              <p>Keep their nails trimmed and occasionally check their ears for debris or signs of infection. Brush their teeth with a veterinarian-approved toothpaste to prevent feline dental disease.</p>
